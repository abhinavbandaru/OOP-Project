It's a simple application that runs on netbeans and uses java swing for animation and uses a localhost database to store all information (client and driver data).

This app also has animation, which moves the car (random location at first, then it stays at the drop location of last passenger) from it's location to the users location, gives a prompt to user on arrival and then takes the user to his destination.

We have used part of the GTA Vice City Map for our map and set corners are locations.
